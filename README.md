# s3gen

* A super-simple website generator

* What I essentially want to be able to do with this app is:
  * point it to a directory and have it available as a website
  * all files and folders will be available as links on the main page
  * markdown files will be rendered as HTML
    * with the source markdown being directly editable
  * all of the above without the requirement of any config files
  * an optional config file to amend the above behaviour

* This will also be my first foray into literate programming
  * however I intend to take a custom quasi-literate approach
