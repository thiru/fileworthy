## Develop

The following will:

* start the website
* launch a REPL
* start an nREPL server
* use rebel-readline
* start figwheel
* open the homepage in your default browser

```shell
$ fileworthy.sh repl
```

The above REPL leaves you in a ClojureScript workspace. If you want another
dedicated REPL for working with your Clojure codebase run the following to
connect to the existing nREPL server:

```shell
$ lein repl :connect 
```
